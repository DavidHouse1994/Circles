# Circles


Create a program that calculates the area and circumference of a circle, given its radius. The program should prompt the user to enter the radius and then display the calculated values.

To extend this project, you could also prompt the user to choose between calculating the area or circumference, and then perform the corresponding calculation. Additionally, you could add error handling to ensure that the user enters a valid radius (e.g., a positive number) and handle any exceptions that may arise.

Area: pi*R^2

Circumference: 2*pi*R
